# FastFourierPresentation
A handout and slide show explaining some of the fundamentals of the fast Fourier transform.

Must be built using `lualatex` with `-shell-escape` and uses `gnuplot` and `perl` to generate some of the graphs. The document could be modified to use static files generated by these utilities but does not currently. The tools used to generate most of the graphs and charts are included in the `./common/` folder, most of them are dynamic and work with variable inputs, a few like the butterfly diagram will not work if given a value other than a power of two but it will not check if this is the case.

This document was made with the Ubuntu font family in mind and parts of the font are included in this repository, the license and copyright for these font files is included in the `./common/fonts/` folder.
